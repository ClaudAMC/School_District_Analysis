# School_District_Analysis
---
## Overview of Project
A School Board has asked for analysis of regional school test scores with a focus on math and reading scores. They are looking to determine next years budget for each school and therefore require summary metrics of each school in order to make this decision. This summary was completed when the school board learned of academic dishonesty happening among the ninth grade students at Thomas Highschool (THS). A new summary has to be constructed for the school board.

### Purpose

Construct a summary analysis of the school in the region for the school board with the updated data - excluding the ninth graders from THS.

## Analysis

The Jupiter Notebook used to complete this analysis is:

## School District Analysis Results

## District Summary

Below is the results of the new district summary.

Below is the results of the old distric summary.

Fromn this we can see that the Average Math Score, the % Passing Math, the % Passing Reading and the % overall passing were all affected by removing the data from the ninth grade students of THS.

### School Summary

We can see here the new school summary where THS is 2nd from the top.

Below we see the old school summary where THS is still 2nd from the Top.

We can see from this that there is a difference in the  Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, the % Passing Math, the % Passing Reading and the % overall passing for THS however the differences are in the order of 0.1 or 0.01 in some cases.

We can see that compared to other schools their position did not get affected.
